# ACT-R

This is a partial implementation of the ACT-R cognitive architecture (see act-r.psy.cmu.edu) in Swift for use in XCode.
The repository implements an iOS App that can play the Prisoner's Dilemma model, both the original Wallach & Lebiere (2000)
model, and the newer Stevens & Taatgen (2015) model.

The ACT-R core files can be used for your own models and your own application.
